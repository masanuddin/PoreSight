PoreSight is an AI-powered computer vision project designed to analyze facial images and detect skin acne and blackheads using deep learning techniques.

The project explores how visual intelligence can be applied to personal skincare analysis in a non-invasive and data-driven way.

## Overview

Skin analysis is often subjective and inconsistent, relying heavily on manual observation or consumer-grade tools. PoreSight approaches this problem by using computer vision to extract visual patterns related to acne and blackheads from facial images.

The system focuses on clarity, reproducibility, and model-driven insight rather than cosmetic scoring.

## Method

PoreSight processes facial images through a computer vision pipeline that includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep learning–based classification or detection. The model is trained and evaluated using labeled image data to assess its ability to recognize face-spots patterns.

The emphasis is placed on model behavior, accuracy, and visual interpretability.

## Technology

PoreSight is built using:
- Python as the primary programming language  
- Ultralytics YOLOv8 for object detection  
- PyTorch for deep learning and model training  
- OpenCV for image preprocessing and visualization  
- Flask as a lightweight backend for web deployment  
- HTML for the frontend interface  

## Purpose

This project demonstrates applied skills in computer vision, deep learning, and image-based analysis. PoreSight highlights how AI can be used responsibly for personal analysis and decision support in skincare-related applications.

## Future

Future development may include acne classification, severity scoring, real-time camera integration, and deployment as a lightweight web or mobile application.
